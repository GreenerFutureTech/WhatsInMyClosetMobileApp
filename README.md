What's In My Closet is an application aimed at revolutionizing how you keep track of your wardrobe!
In this app you can keep track of which closet/space your item is stored in. You can take a picture
and have its background removal for a tidy view into the items that you have catalogued. 

There is also a feature to help get rid of items you no longer want by putting them up for "swap" within the community.
This allows other users to see what items you have up for swap, and then they are able to offer their own items to perform
an exchange of goods. 

This app is designed to help prevent waste, and to help real people keep better track of their own items
to reduce unneeded shopping!

This repository is for the mobile app.

Features:
Organize wardrobe items by:
-Creating a wardrobe (public or private)
-Taking a picture of the item to catalogue (GoogleML used to remove background from image)
-Select which wardrobe and which organizational tags to accompany the item
-Add friends
-View friends' public wardrobe
-Put an item up for "Swap"
-Perform swaps with other users

This is a mobile app created using Kotlin Multiplatform to target Android as well as iOS.
This project uses a Node.JS back end utilizing the Nest.JS framework.
